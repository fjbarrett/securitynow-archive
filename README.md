# Security Now! (Archive) RSS Feed

Archive of Security Now! RSS feed. Episode data is sourced through [grc.com/securitynow.htm](https://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm).

Only episodes up to #7 have been added. The <code>rss.xml</code> in this repo can be uploaded to an endpoint and used in a podcatcher. I would not recommend using this RSS in its current state. It's constantly being updated and I'm making mistakes throughout.
